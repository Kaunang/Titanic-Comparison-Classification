# Titanic: Classification Comparison with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
This project explores the application of two popular machine learning methods, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to the classification task on the Titanic dataset. The main objective is to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, fare, class, and other demographics. By comparing these two methods, the project aims to determine which model performs better and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each in this context.

# Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is a common benchmark in data science, covering the passenger information of the RMS Titanic. The project involves several key steps:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, performing feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
Modeling: Applying Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models to a binary classification task (survival/non-survival).
Model Comparison: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Analysis and Conclusion: Analyzing the results to identify the model that provides better predictive performance and provides insights into feature importance.

# Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the application of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting on the Titanic dataset. Through evaluation using visualizations and statistical metrics, the project revealed important insights into the performance of both models and the features that most influenced the predictions.
